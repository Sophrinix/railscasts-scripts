# RailsCasts Scripts

Scripts used in the production of RailsCasts. http://railscasts.com/

These scripts do the following:

1. Generate a new project directory with the proper templates

    rcnew '123 Some Episode'

2. Process edited video by adding intro and normalizing and cleaning up audio

    # no script yet

3. Encode video into different formats

    rcencode 123-some-episode.mov

4. Upload them to the server

    rcupload path/to/123-some-episode/


If you have any suggestions on how to improve this, especially regards to encoding, please add an issue to this project.
